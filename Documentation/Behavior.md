# Behavior

*How this package behaves.*

<br>

## Updates

- New icons are added to your existing config.

- New file extensions are added to existing <br>
  icons if they haven't already been used.

<br>

*This strategy expects there to be little to no* <br>
*reassignments of file extension on our part.*

*However, the config can be reset to the latest* <br>
*default configuration if you really want to.*

<br>

## Resetting

*Not yet implemented.* <br>
*Manually replace your config.*
